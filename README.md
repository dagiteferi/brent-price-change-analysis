## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze Brent oil price fluctuations by detecting change points and identifying their causes using statistical modeling. By leveraging time series models such as ARIMA, GARCH, and Bayesian methods (PyMC3), we investigate how economic, political, and regulatory events impact oil prices. The insights generated will help investors, policymakers, and analysts make informed decisions. 💡

## Key Objectives 🎯

- Detect change points in Brent oil prices over the past decades. 📊
- Analyze the impact of key events (e.g., political decisions, economic sanctions, OPEC policies) on price fluctuations. 🌐
- Apply statistical modeling techniques such as Bayesian inference, ARIMA, and GARCH. 📉
- Develop an interactive dashboard using Flask and React for visualizing results. 🖥️
- Provide actionable insights for investment strategies, policy development, and risk management. 📈

## Data 📂

- **Source:** Historical Brent oil prices dataset (1987 - 2022).
- **Fields:**
  - `Date`: Daily recorded price (Format: DD-MMM-YY).
  - `Price`: Brent oil price in USD per barrel.
