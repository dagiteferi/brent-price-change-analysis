## üìù The Data Analysis Workflow  

To analyze Brent oil prices and detect change points effectively, I used the following approach:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Understanding the Dataset**  
- The dataset used is **BrentOilPrices.csv** (1987 - 2022).  
- It contains:  
  - **Date**: The day oil prices were recorded.  
  - **Price**: Brent crude oil price (USD per barrel).  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing** üßπ  
- Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.  
- Ensure data consistency (e.g., remove duplicate entries if they exist).  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üìä**  
- Plot **price trends over time** to identify visible patterns.  
- Analyze statistical properties such as **mean, variance, stationarity, seasonality, and volatility**.  
- Use **histograms, box plots, and rolling statistics** to gain insights into price fluctuations.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Change Point Detection & Statistical Modeling**  
- Apply **change point detection methods** to identify significant shifts in oil prices:  
  - **Bayesian Change Point Detection**  
  - **Likelihood Ratio Tests**  
  - **CUSUM (Cumulative Sum Control Chart)**  
  - **Pettitt‚Äôs Test**  
- Implement **time series models** to understand trends and volatility:  
  - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
  - **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**  
  - **Bayesian Methods (PyMC3)** for probabilistic trend detection.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation & Selection** ‚úÖ  
- Compare models using **evaluation metrics** such as:  
  - **AIC/BIC** (Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria)  
  - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
  - **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**  
- Select the best-performing model for predicting oil price fluctuations.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Interpretation of Findings & Insights** üîç  
- Correlate **change points** with real-world events (e.g., political, economic, and regulatory changes).  
- Identify how external factors such as **OPEC decisions, economic sanctions, and geopolitical events** impact oil prices.  

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Communicating Results to Stakeholders** üì¢  
- Present insights through:  
  - **Interactive Dashboard (Flask + React)** to visualize trends and predictions.  
  - **Blog Report** summarizing key findings, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
